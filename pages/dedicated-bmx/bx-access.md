Access control lists can be used to manage access to the service. As the bucket owner, you can control read and write access to your bucket or the objects it contains. Access control lists are not available for the service instance or at the project level.
{: shortdesc}

When you create a bucket, you are automatically given "own" permissions. This permission gives you full control over your bucket and the objects inside. For more information about granting and restricting access for others, see the [S3 API reference documentation](https://ibm-public-cos.github.io/crs-docs/crs-api-reference.html#create-an-acl-for-an-object).
