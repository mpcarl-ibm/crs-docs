Please contact IBM sales to enroll.The user interface portal provides a high level view of a storage account.  It is possible to create buckets and upload objects using the portal, but typically most interaction with the object store is done through the API by a client application.Using buckets  Click the Account Name in the above accounts list to open the details page for that account.  The details page shows the following info on the top header bar:          Name of the account currently being viewed      The current region being viewed      The total capacity usage in the current billing cycle      The total bandwidth usage in the current billing cycle        The page also shows the list of buckets present in the account.  A new bucket can be added by clicking on the + button at the right of the first row.  The new bucket name can be entered and the new bucket added, by clicking the Add button. Bucket names must be DNS-compliant (between 3 and 63 characters long and must be made of lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes) and must be globally unique (possibly by appending a UUID or other distinctive suffix to bucket names).  A bucket can be deleted, by clicking the red - button to the extreme right of the bucket name. This opens a confirmation window.  Click the Delete button to remove the bucket from the account. Note: only empty buckets can be deleted.  Attempting to delete a non-empty bucket will result in an error.Using objects  The objects present within a bucket can be viewed, by clicking the bucket name on the buckets list.  The header is updated to include the following info:          Name of the account currently being viewed      The current region being viewed      The name of the bucket whose objects are currently displayed      The type of the bucket whose objects are currently displayed        Above the grid on the left is a link with the name of the bucket currently viewed. Click the link to show the list of buckets again.  The grid shows the list of objects in the bucket.  A new object can be added, by clicking the + button at the right of the first row.  The file can be selected from the file system, by clicking the select button and the new file uploaded, by clicking the Add button.  When using the portal to add an object, file size is limited to 20 megabytes.  An object can be deleted, by clicking on the red - button to the extreme right of the object name. This opens a confirmation window.  Click the Delete button to remove the object from the bucket."

Endpoints should be chosen based on proximity to the application servers accessing the object store to minimize latency.  For workloads not concentrated in a single geographic area, the US Region endpoint distributes connections among the regional data centers.  Endpoints can be accessed over either plaintext or SSL depending on security requirements.Types of endpoint:  Public endpoints can be accessed from anywhere and charges are assessed on outgoing bandwidth. Incoming bandwidth is free. Public endpoints should be used for access not originating from a SoftLayer data center.  Private endpoints can be accessed by customers running Virtual Machines or Bare Metal Servers on SoftLayer. Private endpoints do not incur charges for any outgoing or incoming bandwidth even if the traffic is cross regions or across data centers. Customers with workloads running in a SoftLayer data center in Dallas, San Jose, or Washington should use the endpoint for that same city. Customers with existing workloads running in a remote SoftLayer data center should use the US Region endpoint.  ADN endpoints allow customers to bring their own IP addresses.

Randomness ensures that the index does not become unbalanced and can lead to significant performance gains.Example of inefficient naming scheme:bashPUT /bucket1/filename-00001PUT /bucket1/filename-00002PUT /bucket1/filename-00003PUT /bucket1/filename-00004PUT /bucket1/filename-00005Examples of an efficient naming scheme:bashPUT /bucket1/c1ca2-filename-00001PUT /bucket1/c9872-filename-00002PUT /bucket1/98837-filename-00003PUT /bucket1/abfc4-filename-00004PUT /bucket1/9ac18-filename-00005Tuning cipher settingsIBM COS supports variety of cipher settings to encrypt data in transit. Not all cipher settings yield the same level performance. Negotiating one of TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA has shown to yield the same levels of performance as no TLS between the client and the IBM COS.Using multipart uploadsIf the objects being stored in IBM COS are all larger objects, it is recommend that multipart upload operation is used to write objects into IBM COS.  Multipart uploads are only available for objects larger than 5MB - depending on the object size a part size of 20MB to 100MB is recommended.  NOTE: Using more than 500 parts leads to inefficiencies in IBM COS and should be avoided.The multipart upload s designed to improve the upload performance for larger objects.  An upload of a single object can be performed as a set of parts and these parts can be uploaded independently in any order, and in parallel.  Upon upload completion, IBM COS then presents all parts as a single object.Using multipart upload provides the following advantages:  Improved throughput—You can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput.  Quick recovery from any network issues—Smaller part size minimizes the impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error.  Pause and resume object uploads—Upload object parts over time. Once a multipart upload is initiated a multipart upload there is no expiry; it must explicitly complete or the multipart upload has to be aborted.  Begin an upload before the final object size is known—An object can be uploaded as it is being created.Due to the additional complexity of multipart uploads, as a best practice; it is recommended that S3 API libraries that offer multipart uploads be used.  NOTE: Incomplete multipart uploads do persist until the object is deleted or the multipart upload is aborted with AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload. If an incomplete multipart upload is not aborted, the partial upload continues to use resources.  Interfaces should be designed with this point in mind, and clean up incomplete multipart uploads.Using software development kitsIt is not mandatory to use published S3 API SDKs; homegrown libraries can be written to integrate with IBM COS. However, using published S3 API libraries provide advantages such as automatic retry logic on 5xx errors. If using home grown libraries to integrate with IBM COS, care must be taken to handle transient errors such as 503s originating from IBM COS. Retries with exponential backing similar to published SDKs must be implemented in these libraries."

A complete list of supported operations can be found here.  Note: this documentation for the Cross-Region beta is in-progress and does not yet provide detailed usage guidance and examples for all supported operations.AuthorizationThe authorization header is required for all requests, and is calculated according to the AWS Signature Version 4 protocol.  This provides identity verification and in-transit data integrity, and is tied to the timestamp of the request.  The header is composed of four components: an algorithm declaration, credential information, signed headers, and the calculated signature:AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential={access-key}/{date}/{region}/s3/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;{other-required-headers}, Signature={signature}The date is provided in YYYYMMDD format, and the region can be any value (e.g. us-geo or us-east-1). The host and x-amz-date headers are always required, and depending on the request other headers may be required as well (e.g. x-amz-content-sha256).  The 256 bit signature is given as 64 hexadecimal character string and is calculated from multiple combinations and hashes of the request elements.  Due to the need to recalulate the signature for every individual request, many developers prefer to use a tool or SDK that will produce the authorization header automatically.  INTERNAL NOTE: The signature calculation process is fairly involved.  Assuming we don’t want to link to AWS documentation, we could describe it on another page here and link to our version of it, or gently suggest the reader research calculation methods.  Thoughts?  Here is the AWS documentation on single payload (as opposed to multipart uploads) signature calculation.Common Headers and Error ResponsesCommon Request HeadersThe following table describes supported common request headers. Headers not listed here will be ignored if sent in a request.            Header      Note                  Authorization      Required for all requests (AWS Signature Version 4).

Access control lists allow for granting different sets of permissions to different storage accounts using the account’s UUID, or by using a pre-made ACL.  INTERNAL NOTE: At this time credentials are generated for each storage account, not for indvidual users.  As such, ACLs do not have the ability to restrict or grant access to a given user, only to a storage account. Similarly, public-read-write allows any other CRS storage account to access the resource, but not the general public.ACLs can use pre-made permissions sets (or ‘canned ACLs’) or be customized in the body of the request. Pre-made ACLs are specified using the x-amz-acl header with private, public-read, or public-read-write as the value. Custom ACLs are specified using XML in the request body and can grant READ, WRITE, READ_ACP (read ACL), WRITE_ACP (write ACL), or FULL_CONTROL permissions to a given storage account.SyntaxPUT http://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}?acl=Sample Request: Basic pre-made ACLThis is an example of specifying a pre-made ACL to allow for public-read access to the “apiary” bucket.
