Please contact IBM sales to enroll if not registered.The user interface portal provides a high level view of a storage account.  It is possible to create buckets and upload objects using the portal, but typically most interaction with the object store is done through the API by a client application.Using buckets  Click the Account Name in the above accounts list to open the details page for that account.  The details page shows the following info on the top header bar:          Name of the account currently being viewed      The current region being viewed      The total capacity usage in the current billing cycle      The total bandwidth usage in the current billing cycle        The page also shows the list of buckets present in the account.  A new bucket can be added by clicking on the + button at the right of the first row.  The new bucket name can be entered and the new bucket added, by clicking the Add button. Bucket names must be DNS-compliant (between 3 and 63 characters long, can not be formatted as an IP address, and can not begin or end with a period) and must be globally unique (possibly by appending a UUID or other disctictive suffix to bucket names).  A bucket can be deleted, by clicking the red - button to the extreme right of the bucket name. This opens a confirmation window.  Click the Delete button to remove the bucket from the account. Note: only empty buckets can be deleted.  Attempting to delete a non-empty bucket will result in an error.Using objects  The objects present within a bucket can be viewed, by clicking the bucket name on the buckets list.  The header is updated to include the following info:          Name of the account currently being viewed      The current region being viewed      The name of the bucket whose objects are currently displayed      The type of the bucket whose objects are currently displayed        Above the grid on the left is a link with the name of the bucket currently viewed. Click the link to show the list of buckets again.  The grid shows the list of objects in the bucket.  A new object can be added, by clicking the + button at the right of the first row.  The file can be selected from the file system, by clicking the select button and the new file uploaded, by clicking the Add button.  When using the portal to add an object, file size is limited to 20 megabytes.  An object can be deleted, by clicking on the red - button to the extreme right of the object name. This opens a confirmation window.  Click the Delete button to remove the object from the bucket."

Endpoints should be chosen based on proximity to the application servers accessing the object store to minimize latency.  For workloads not concentrated in a single geographic area, the US Region endpoint distributes connections among the regional data centers.  Endpoints can be accessed over either plaintext or SSL depending on security requirements.Types of endpoint:  Public endpoints can be accessed from anywhere, and customers are charged for outgoing bandwidth. Incoming bandwidth is free.  Customers without existing workloads running in SoftLayer data centers should use public endpoints.  Private endpoints can be accessed by customers running Virtual Machines or Bare Metal Servers on SoftLayer. Private endpoints do not incur charges for any outgoing or incoming bandwidth even if the traffic is cross regions or across data centers. Customers with existing workloads running in a SoftLayer data center in Dallas, San Jose, or Washington should use the endpoint for that same city. Customers with existing workloads running in a remote SoftLayer data center should use the US Region endpoint.  ADN endpoints allow customers to bring their own IP addresses. If customer have an ADN account and use an ADN endpoint, they will not be charged for any outgoing or incoming bandwidth.

Click the credentials header to expand and show the credentials.  An account can have a maximum of two credentials at once. This allows for credentials to rotated in applications without interruption. A new credential can be created, by clicking the Add credential button just below the Credentials header.  A credential can also be deleted, by clicking the - button to the right of the credential. A confirmation dialog will pop-up for confirmation before the credential is deleted.  The page also shows the various authentication endpoints that can be used to access the account.Billing  Information on pricing can be found in the SoftLayer store.  Each account receives a single bill. If you need separate billing for different sets of containers, then creating multiple accounts is necessary.  Invoices can be found at Account &amp;gt; Billing &amp;gt; Invoices in the navigation menu."
